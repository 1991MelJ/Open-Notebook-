###Creating a Sub-Domain for My Final Project

**First Attempt:**
So I installed Scalar because I liked how the interface was designed to display different medias and I think I can create a nicer design for my project here as oppose to WordPress. I installed Scalar as a sub-domain to my theproudhistorynerd.com site. Click [here](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide/getting-started) for tips on using Scalar, you can also find the forum for Scalar [here](http://scalar.usc.edu/scalar/forums/). My sub-domain is final-project.theproudhistorynerd.com.

User's Guide for using Maps can be found [here](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide/maps?path=third-party-plugins-and-platforms). Guide for creating a "path" on the domain can be found [here](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide/reading-in-scalar?path=getting-started). I found this domain very difficult to manage so I decided to uninstall. I created a WordPress sub-domain, if this does not work well another option to consider is a [github page](https://pages.github.com/).
