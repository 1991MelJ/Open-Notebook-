##Future Books Idea altered to Progress of Open Access Publishing!

So after speaking to Dr. Graham about my initial project ideas he advised me to focus my research around history, and how history is being produced and taught using digital books. He advised me to look at JSTOR and find scholarly research that looked at changes within publishing. 

Also, Dr. Graham directed me to [Module 4 Excercise 6](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-4/Exercises) in our course workbook, which talks about analyzing text using Voyant. This tool can be useful for me because Voyant can be used to visualize patterns in words, and can arrange data in chronological order so we can see changes over time. 

Another tool that I think will be useful is using TWARC to grab, archive, share, inflate, and visualize tweets. I want to use this to mine Twitter, and see what patterns emerge when the tweets `OA` `openaccess` `humanities` `history` are used, especially when they are used in a combination. I am not sure if I want to focus my attention on Canada, but given that [Canada's open access initiatives](http://open.canada.ca/en/blog/open-data-across-canada-snapshot) are not very extensive I am considering looking at the US, and Europe as well. 

###Some Things to Consider:

* how has open access publishing affected author outreach?
* how have governments been involved in open access movement?
* "open libraries" - open online journal databases, how has membership/readership changed, how had institution/university membership and shared published articles/books changed?
* 5+ years since open access movement began, may have started with Open Access Initiative in [Budapest, 2002](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read) it is a global movement which has spread to a variety of disciplines 
* Read [oapenuk research findings](http://oapen-uk.jiscebooks.org/files/2016/01/OAPEN-UK-final-report-single-page-view.pdf) to understand authors' and publishers' perspectives and sentiments towards openness in the UK
* also look into 'Goldâ€™ open access, which means that research work is made freely available without subscription fee or restrictions on access which is talked about in the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org). Also in Canada there is the [Tri-Agency Open Access Policy on Publications](http://www.science.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F6765465-1) to improve access to research publications and data which uses public funding through federal granting agencies: CIHR, NSERC, or SSHRC.
