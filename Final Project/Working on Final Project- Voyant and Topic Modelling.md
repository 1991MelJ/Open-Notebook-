I told Dr. Graham about my issue with Voyant and he suggested that I remove some terms from my search. Thankfully this helped. The image for my results are here. The image URL is [here](http://voyant-tools.org/tool/Cirrus/?corpus=1459791714699.7807&stopList=1459887695378tc), also a copy of the image is here:

I also fed my data into Topic Modeling. My files for the output are [output_csv](https://github.com/1991MelJ/Open-Notebook-/tree/master/Final%20Project/output_csv) and [output_html](https://github.com/1991MelJ/Open-Notebook-/tree/master/Final%20Project/output_html). This is a browser-based way of navigating my topics and document, I can input this into a spreadsheet for visualization. I will try this in Overview because it may have been giving me an issue for the same reason Voyant was, so this way my data is already sorted and I applied stop words.

I added a new theme to my final project blog, hopefully this will work for me. The site is here: http://final-project.theproudhistorynerd.com/
