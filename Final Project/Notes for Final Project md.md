##Jan 22: Initial Ideas!

I started thinking deeper on how I could explore the idea of "future books." I first started thinking about it when I came across a TED talk by Brian Dettmer who spoke about the idea of physical books evolving as information becomes virtual. I first mentioned my curiosity on the subject on [my Dillinger exercise][1] when I made reference to Dettmer's art work, which was created from old books.

So I started thinking: Books in the physical form, will they die out? Will they change form? What evidence is there that they are dying or changing? Are there new technologies or innovations that could revolutionize the book? 
What would all of this mean if books are changing? Does it mean people value books less? Or does it mean that the value attributed to books has/is shifting? Can books be given new meaning? Or will they always be associated with information? Can we consume the information within books different? Are e-books evolving?

So my mind started racing on all the different things I could explore to try and find out what "future books" could be like. 

###Here are some more questions I will consider:

-Do e-books cost the writer less money to get a book published? Will an increase in e-books increase self publishing, and make it easier for people who do not have a background in writing to become authors? And will the e-book make books more accessible?
-Are physical books decreasing in print since the creation of e-book?
-Does location/country show difference in e-book popularity? And what does that data mean?
-Are specific kinds of books increasing/decreasing in print sales? ex: encyclopedia vs. e-book 
-Will there be/ are there NEW FORMS of books ex: e-book, hologram-books could they become an invention? 
-Are there/will there be NEW TYPES of books ex: books written to give the reader a new experience (like gamebooks) or a new subject for books?
-What does increase/decrease in sales of different types/forms of books tell you about what people value ex: desire for accurate information causing people to turn more to the internet than to physical dictionaries. Also audio books not popular, why? Do people value reading the words themselves rather than listening to them? 
-Does age play a factor? Do older generations prefer print, do younger generations prefer e-books?
-Is there evidence that there are NEW USES for books? ex: books for art, is this a growing trend, are there other uses for physical books that did not exist before?

-Where can I find data? On Google? Maybe tract changes in sales from companies like Chapters? Also can use bookstores to see changes in book forms/types

###What things can electronic books do in the future?

-Books can become SUSTAINABLE, be created in new forms that can be updated while also more environmentally friendly. New forms would mean authors can take more risks with books and publish new content.
-Issue of ipads/tablets not being intimate while physical books are intimate. What if e-books could create a form of INTIMACY? I found an example of this on IDEO's website an app called Alice. They developed possible apps that could be developed for enhancing the virtual reading experience. I will post links to these apps in another note.
-E-books could change the way we teach and learn in school, they could become the new "textbook" they could dramatically decrease the cost of textbooks for university/college students. They can be more interactive and engaging within the classroom. They can also change the way we read words. ex: Spritz created a form of virtual reading that enhances your reading speed, they also are being used to help children learn to read and read faster. Will post more in another note.
-Can books promote SOCIAL interaction and exchange of ideas or could they appear to do that and make people less engaged in the real world (i.e: physical world not virtual world)? ex: IDEO app Couplan
-Can e-books create new ways for writers to ENGAGE with readers? ex: interactive ebooks, personalization of stories, reader participating in story like in gamebooks like "Choose Your Own Adventure" or "Give Yourself Goosebumps" where the reader was the protagonist and their choices determined the outcome of the stories. 
-Will there be new WAYS of telling stories? ex: more interactive reading experiences than what was featured in gamebooks  IDEO's Alice would allow readers to unlock clues, communicate with other characters, solve puzzles, etc if apps like this were to be developed it would allow writers to experiment and create non-linear story paths that could lead to new ways of story telling. 

Cool stuff, I've found some interesting things so far, some interesting ideas that people have and even physical books that are showing how the book is evolving. I'm not sure yet how I will use what I find and how I will narrow it down, but I think I want to focus on the what the future of books COULD be and what evidence there is of that. We will see.
