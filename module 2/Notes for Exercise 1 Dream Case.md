A "dream case" is a database that gives data that is sorted and structured. A database that lays out its decision making and how it deals with ambiguities. This gives you a well informed spreadsheet of data.

I chose to use the [Epigraphic Database Heidelberg]( http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/inschrift/suche/ "EDH Search Page") to perform a search of the word "agricola" which is Latin for "farmer." I also downloaded an excel spreadsheet of the data that resulted from my search.

[Here is a copy of what I downloaded][1]

And here is the Link for my initial search results:
