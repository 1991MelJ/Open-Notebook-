So I had never heard of dillinger.io or Markdown, and so this was the first time I had ever created a markdown file that converts to plain text. I used the guidelines from Sarah Simpkin [The Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown "Getting Started with Markdown"). I had issues because I found the examples on the Programming Historian page did not specify where spaces should and should not go when entering URL in markdown to get reference style links and in text images. Which made a difference when trying to get links and images to show on dillinger properly. So I had to play around with it a bit to get the links to turn out how I needed them to. As for the images, I was entering the URL in the correct format but the dillinger page was not showing my images, instead it showed a box with the name I had given my images. I spoke to my classmate Catherine Hood and she suggested that I use Google images, and told me that I may not have been getting the proper Image URL from Flickr and instead I was getting the URL for the Flickr page. I'm glad I mentioned my issue to her because she was right, and the Google images worked perfectly. I'm happy with how my first document with Markdown came out.
