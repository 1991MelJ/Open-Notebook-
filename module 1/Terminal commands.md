HOW TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE/CHANGE WHERE YOU ARE:
To see where you are in Terminal type "pwd"
If it shows "melissanelson$" you need to be in a specific file to make any changes to your github.
Then type "ls" and Terminal will show you all files under melissanelson user. 
Type "cd" for change directory--move from one file to the next--then type the file you need ex: "cd open-notebook-"
This is how I pulled changes to my github from terminal:
