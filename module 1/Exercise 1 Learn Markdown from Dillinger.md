# About Me.
                                                            
                                                               
I am currently a Special Student at Carleton University, in 2013 I completed my undergraduate degree in History with a minor in Sociology. I decided to return to Carleton to take additional courses in hopes of making my grades more competitive for graduate school. I am very interested in mastering in Archival Studies, and as such, I saw this course as an opportunity for me to explore the uses of Digital History and virtual archives as they are becoming increasingly relevant within the field. As institutions, such as museums and art galleries,  evolve and turn to online spaces to interact with the public and foster learning I find it important for me to familiarize myself with the digital aspects of history.  
                                                                 I do not consider myself a "tech-savvy" person in any way, shape or form as I do not have much digital experience other than using social media platforms. I have been strongly encouraged by my younger sister to start my own blog, but I never thought that this would be feasible for me. I look forward to learning how to blog, as well as how to become comfortable with creating an online presence and voice. Furthermore, I am interested in exploring how online spaces can be utilized for both conducting research and teaching history. 

# Just a Thought.
I am also drawn to the idea that as individuals and institutions rely more on virtual spaces for sharing and accessing information, how we use physical books, and how we perceive them will evolve over time. Working with the idea that "the age of information in the physical form is waning," artist [Brian Dettmer][1] created a series of sculptures out of books to reflect his belief that the book will evolve as virtual forms of information continue to thrive:

> "And I think of my work as almost an archaeology. I'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work. But at the same time, I'm thinking about this idea of erasure, and what's happening now that most of our information is intangible, and this idea of loss, and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers, but the information itself, now that we don't have a physical backup, has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it."
